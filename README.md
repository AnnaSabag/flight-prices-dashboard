# ✈️ Flight Prices Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Flight Prices Dashboard** is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to help users analyze and visualize trends in flight ticket pricing across multiple destinations.  
The data was collected in real-time using a **Python web scraper** that connects to the **Skyscanner API**, making this a great example of combining automated data collection with BI analytics.

The dashboard provides insights into flight costs over time, airline distribution, cheapest days to fly, and destination comparisons — helping travelers and analysts identify optimal travel decisions.
